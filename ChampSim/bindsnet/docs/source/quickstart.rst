Quickstart
==========

Check out some example use cases for BindsNET in the :code:`examples/` folder
(`link <https://github.com/Hananel-Hazan/bindsnet/tree/master/examples>`_). For example, changing directory to
`[bindsnet-root]/examples/mnist` and running the following will result in a near-replication of the architecture of
`Diehl & Cook 2015 <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

	python eth_mnist.py [options]


The token :code:`[options]` should be replaced with any command-line arguments you'd like to use to modify the behavior
of the program.
